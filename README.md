# HW19-User-Directory

## Description
An employee directory that is made from React.

## User Story
AS A user
I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once
SO THAT I have quick access to their information

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Other Criteria/Features
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:

* Sort the table by at least one category

* Filter the users by at least one property.

* Employees are being pulled from a third-party API: (https://randomuser.me/api/)

## Technologies Used
React, Axios, Heroku, Random User API
